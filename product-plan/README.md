# EVAZ-MS Landing Page — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement the EVAZ-MS landing page.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (always provide with instructions)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — 5 milestone instructions (foundation + 4 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components (Header, Footer, MobileMenu)
- `sections/` — 4 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — adapt to your testing setup.

## Sections

| # | Section | ID | Description |
|---|---------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation | foundation | Shell, header, footer, navigation |
| 2 | Hero | hero-section | Headline, CTAs, audience cards |
| 3 | Services | services-section | 12 service packages with tabs |
| 4 | Benefits | benefits-section | 4 benefit cards, team carousel |
| 5 | Contact | contact-section | Form, phone, messengers |

## Key Technical Details

- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Colors:** Teal (primary), Cream (secondary), Stone (neutral)
- **Fonts:** Playfair Display (headings), Montserrat (body)
- **Language:** Ukrainian (preserve all text as-is)

## Backend Requirements

The Contact Section requires:
1. Form submission endpoint
2. Email notification (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
3. Telegram notification (bot integration)

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions
- **Preserve Ukrainian text** — All labels, messages, and content are in Ukrainian
- **Components are props-based** — Wire up callbacks to your routing/API
- **Focus on backend** — UI is complete, build the data layer
